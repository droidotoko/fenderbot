## Lights OFF

### Fender Bot is an improved version of the [No Fishing](https://github.com/rishabhAjay/noFishing) bot that scans for Malware or Virus links along with phishing and removes them from your server.\*\*

**Credits to [This Repo](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links/blob/main/domain-list.json) for creating a comprehensive phishing domain dictionary.**

**All thanks to the free API by [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to make the bot even better.**

**You may refer to the [node-virustotal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-virustotal) docs for integrating virustotal into your node app.**

**To create an app instance on discord, you may refer to this guide [discord-bot-in-node-js-for-beginners](https://buddy.works/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-in-node-js-for-beginners)**
